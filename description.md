First of all I would like to start of by saying that I kept ignoring the fact that we had to do a video recoding.
By the time that I asked if we need it to do it, it was to late because I keep having trouble with my mic and the sound comes 
in and out and I don't know how to fix it. I don't want to lose points so hopefully this description helps 

I started off my installing 
package.json (npm install <package_name>)

Then I import module 
const inquirer = require("inquirer");
const fs = require("fs");
and I just realized that I for got to export const generateMarkdown = require("./generateMarkdown.js");

I was looking at the mini-project as reference and added async but then I notice we weren't going to need it because we weren't going to use HTML
but if I took it off the my code wasn't working... I don't know why... it wasn't giving me an err.

for my object questions I made sure to use the description on https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

one thing that I didn't understand was in the homework readme it said to 

3.)WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options

THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

I couldn't fine it in https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer

for the last part of my code I was confused because I didn't see the generateMarkdown until the last 20 minutes to turn in the homework.

side note 
I didn't get to spend as much time on this homework as I would have like to, I was sick this last week and it was word to be on the computer/laptop
